### Project Description

This open-source repository is dedicated to the development and exploration of machine learning models, with a primary focus on dataset preprocessing and data cleaning. Our goal is to build, analyze, and improve various machine learning classifiers while highlighting the importance of high-quality data preprocessing in achieving accurate and robust results.

## How to Start and Rules

1. **Enter into the specific folder**: Choose either the "Supervised Learning" or "Unsupervised Learning" folder based on your project type.
2. **Create a folder** with the name of your project within the chosen folder.
3. **Make a markdown file** within your project folder and specify the details of the ML model you are building. Detailed documentation of the process is preferred if you can.
4. **Load the dataset folder** you are going to use for training, validation, and testing. If the dataset is too large or not possible to push, include the link or source of the dataset at the top of the markdown file you created before (Kaggle, Drive, etc...).
