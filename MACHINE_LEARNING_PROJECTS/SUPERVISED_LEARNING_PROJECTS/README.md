### Supervised Learning Projects

**Description**: This section is for projects that use labeled datasets to train classifiers or regression models. It emphasizes fundamental applications of supervised learning techniques.

**Examples of Projects**:

- **Classification Models**: Predicting discrete class labels based on input features, like spam email detection or sentiment analysis.
- **Regression Models**: Predicting numerical values, such as sales forecasting or house price prediction.

**Dataset Requirements**: Projects should use datasets where each data point is labeled with the correct output.
