### Unsupervised Learning Projects

**Description**: This section focuses on projects that explore unlabeled datasets using unsupervised learning techniques.

**Examples of Projects**:

- **Clustering Algorithms**: Grouping data points based on similarity, like customer segmentation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of variables while preserving data structure, useful for data visualization.

**Dataset Requirements**: Projects should use datasets where data points are not labeled with specific outcomes.

### Guidance:

- **Scope**: Emphasize basic classifier projects in the "Supervised Learning" section and foundational unsupervised learning tasks in the corresponding section.
- **Documentation**: Encourage clear documentation on dataset details, preprocessing steps, and key findings for transparency.
