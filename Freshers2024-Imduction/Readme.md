## 📖 **Introduction to Machine Learning**

### 🤖 **What is Machine Learning?**
   - Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming.
   - It allows us to create models that can make predictions or decisions based on data.

### 🧠 **Types of Machine Learning**
   - **Supervised Learning:** Learning with labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
   - **Unsupervised Learning:** Learning from unlabeled data to find patterns (e.g., clustering).
   - **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning through feedback and rewards (e.g., game AI).

### 🔄 **Machine Learning Workflow**
   1. **Data Collection:** Gather and preprocess data.
   2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features for the model.
   3. **Model Selection:** Choose the appropriate ML algorithm.
   4. **Training and Evaluation:** Train the model on data and evaluate its performance.
   5. **Deployment:** Deploy the model for real-world use.

### 🌍 **Practical Applications**
   - **Image Recognition:** Face recognition, medical imaging.
   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Chatbots, language translation.
   - **Predictive Analytics:** Stock price prediction, weather forecasting.
   - **Recommendation Systems:** Personalized content in streaming platforms.
